# Overview

My name is Andres Castro and I'm a senior software engineering student. 
I love web design and I've had the opportunity to participate in several projects focused on web front-end development. My Preffered programing lengauges are javaScript, C# and Phyton. 

My Goal as a programmer is becoming in a full-stack developer with the capacity to create complex applications that make a difference in our day-by-day like Spotify, Uber, Netflix, bank apps, etc. 

This is a Hellow World with Python!
